# Password and account access issues 🗝️

## Description
The user reports they can’t log in to an account or internal system. In most cases, they see a password error or get locked out after a few attempts.

## Possible causes 🛠️
- Wrong password (typing, keyboard layout, caps lock)
- Account locked after multiple failed attempts
- Password expired due to company policy
- The user is using the wrong username/email
- Temporary authentication or sync issue

## Initial checks 🔎
1. Ask for the exact error message on screen (copy/paste if possible)
2. Confirm the username/login being used
3. Check whether the account is locked or the password has expired
4. Confirm whether the issue happens in more than one system (or only one)

## Recommended actions ✅
- Guide the user through the official password reset process
- Unlock the account if your procedure allows it (or escalate to the right team)
- Ask the user to try again after the reset/unlock and confirm access

## Notes 📝
Keep the process simple and follow security policies. If anything looks suspicious (multiple unexpected lockouts, unusual behavior), document it and escalate.
