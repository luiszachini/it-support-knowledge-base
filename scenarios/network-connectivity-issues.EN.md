# Network connectivity issues 🛜

## Description
The user reports they can’t access the internet or internal services. This may happen on Wi-Fi or wired connection and can be temporary or persistent.

## Possible causes 🛠️
- Wi-Fi disconnected or connected to the wrong network
- Ethernet cable unplugged or damaged
- IP address not assigned correctly (DHCP issue)
- DNS problem (internet works poorly, some sites/services fail)
- Temporary network instability or maintenance

## Initial checks 🔎
1. Ask whether other devices/users are affected (same location/network)
2. Confirm if the user is on Wi-Fi or cable and which network they are connected to
3. Check the network status icon and basic connection details
4. Ask the user to reconnect (Wi-Fi) or reseat the cable (wired)
5. If allowed, run a basic test (e.g., ping gateway / open a known internal page)

## Recommended actions ✅
- Reconnect to the correct Wi-Fi network and test again
- Restart the device if the issue persists and there’s no wider outage
- Renew the IP address if the device is not receiving one
- Escalate to the infrastructure/network team if multiple users are impacted

## Notes 📝
Document what was tested and the results (what worked, what didn’t). This helps a lot when escalating.
